# espanso match file

# For a complete introduction, visit the official docs at: https://espanso.org/docs/

# You can use this file to define the base matches (aka snippets)
# that will be available in every application when using espanso.

# Matches are substitution rules: when you type the "trigger" string
# it gets replaced by the "replace" string.
matches:
  # Simple text replacement
  - trigger: ":espanso"
    replace: "Hi there!"

  # NOTE: espanso uses YAML to define matches, so pay attention to the indentation!

  # But matches can also be dynamic:

  # Print the current date
  - trigger: ":date"
    replace: "{{mydate}}"
    vars:
      - name: mydate
        type: date
        params:
          format: "%m/%d/%Y"

  # Print the output of a shell command
  - trigger: ":shell"
    replace: "{{output}}"
    vars:
      - name: output
        type: shell
        params:
          cmd: "echo 'Hello from your shell'"
  
  - trigger: ":prs"
    replace: "py manage.py runserver"
  
  - trigger: ":sa"
    replace: "./env/Scripts/Activate.ps1"
  
  - trigger: ":ga"
    replace: "git add ."
  
  - trigger: ":gc"
    replace: "git commit -m"

  - trigger: ":gp"
    replace: "git push origin"
  
  - trigger: ":pmm"
    replace: "py manage.py makemigrations"
  
  - trigger: ":pmt"
    replace: "py manage.py migrate"

  - trigger: ":gr"
    replace: "go run main.go"
